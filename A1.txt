I think of  Software Design as an intermediary step between formal requirements and implementation. It is the process of creating documentation that defines the architecture of a software program at a high enough level to abstract away exact implementation details. Design can include more general patterns or models that pre-define abstract components and the interactions between components that should be satisfied during implementation.
